## Review
 - Since this was written in notepad with a weird font, some of the indents wrong
 - JS uses camelCase and I use PascalCase and keep switching between them which can cause confusion with variables/id/class/etc (camelCase for CSS due to element selectors being undercase)
 - Use of inline css combined with external, can be hard to debug rather than using id in place of inline
 - Could not figure out how to use CSS for these : 
    - Format the articles so that the textbox and imgage&table box are equal height
    - Make it mobile device friendly
    - Make the textarea in form page to resize based on available space (flexgrow or grid layout or @media queries)
    - Make text area and rest of form to rotate so that they don't squeeze in smaller width devices like mobile
