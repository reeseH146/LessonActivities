            Hello, this is my site, I can show you how to do some HTML
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> HTML documents have the file extentions ".html"
                <li> You start the document with "<!DOCTYPE = HTML>" so that programs that open this file understand what kind of file this is
                <li> 
            </ul>
            <br>
            ```
            
            ```
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
