Selection - Program branching into different blocks of code to execute
Iteration - Repeating a block of code multiple times
Sequence - Going through the code line by line

```
A = input()
B = input()
if A == B:
    print("Values are the same")
elif A > B:
    print("A is larger than B")
elif A < B:
    print("B is larger than A")
```

Advantage of writing a program in a modular is that it makes it quicker and easier to implement a project since the project can be broken down into different modules that different people can work on different modules at the same time rather than each part of the project at a time.

Programming with a modular approach also makes it easier to track variables and ensure they are not confused with each other with the use of local variables which allows commonly used names to be reused in the program.

Modular approach to writing an application means they can be reusable components which allows some components to be reused without having to be rewritten.
